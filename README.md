# Quantum singular value transformation (QSVT)

The Quantum singular value transformation is a novel technique that tieds together a number of quantum algorthims such as the quantum seach, quantum phase estimation and the Hamiltonian simulation. It performs a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. 

This technical report presents how quantum signal processing may be generalized to quantum eigenvalue transformation, from which the QSVT emerges. This report is primarely based on the Grand Unification paper. 

### Quantum signal processing (QSP)
The quantum signal processing is build on interleaving two kinds of single-qubit rotations: a signal rotation operator and a signal processing rotation. 
The signal rotation, commenly known as a X rotation through the Bloch sphere, always rotates through the same angle θ and the signal processing rotation, commenly know as a Z rotation through the Bloch sphere, rotates through a variable angle according to some predetermined sequence.
